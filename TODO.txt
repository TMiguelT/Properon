[x] Hook-based components for transformations: provide element with offset and size proportions (ie, this element has 3 length and this element has 7 length means a 3:7 ratio), then a hook takes these numbers and calculates a scaling and offset value. This can then be accessed using a hook that gives you a transform function. Possibly the parent has to first check all children to work out the sum of proportions before it can pass down the scale function as a prop or maybe as a context.
